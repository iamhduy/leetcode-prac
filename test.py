You're an advanced AI expert, so even if I give you a complex sentence, you'll still be able to perform the relationship extraction task. The output format MUST be a dictionary where key is the source sentence and value is a list consisting of the extracted triple.
        - A triple is a basic data structure used to represent knowledge graphs, which are structured semantic knowledge bases that describe concepts and their relationships in the physical world. A triple MUST has THREE elements: [Subject, Relation,  Object]. For example, "[Subject:FinSpy malware, Relation:was the final payload]"(2 elements) and "[Subject:FinSpy malware, Relation:was, Object:the final payload, None:that will be used]"(4 elements) do not contain exactly 3 elements and should be discard.The subject and the object are Noun. The relation is a relation that connects the subject and the object, and expresses how they are related. For example, [Formbook, is, malware] is a triple that describes the relationship between the malware Formbook and the concept of malware. 
        - In entity extraction, you follow those rules:
        Rule 1: Only extract triples that are related to cyber attacks. If a sentence does not have any triple about cyber attacks, skip the sentence and do not print it in your output.\
        Rule 2: Make sure your results is a python dictionary format. One example is {source sentence1:[[subject1, relation1, object1],[subject2, relation2, object2]...],source sentence2:[[subject3, relation3, object3],[subject4, relation4, object4]...]} 
        Rule 3: You must use ellipsis in source sentence to save space. The output format should be  “First word Second word ... penu word last word”, For example, “The malware ... the system”.
        - Here is one sentence from example article:\"Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts.\"
        The correct answer is: {Leafminer attempts ... of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts:[[SUBJECT:Leafminer,RELATION:attempts to infiltrate,OBJECT:target networks],[SUBJECT:Leafminer,RELATION:use,OBJECT:watering hole websites],[SUBJECT:Leafminer,RELATION:use,OBJECT:vulnerability scans of network services on the internet],[SUBJECT:Leafminer,RELATION:use,OBJECT:brute-force],[SUBJECT:Leafminer,RELATION:use,OBJECT:dictionary login attempts]]}.

        The correct answer is: {Kismet is ... wireless LAN discovery.:[[SUBJECT:Kismet,RELATION:is a powerful tool for, OBJECT:penetration testers],[SUBJECT:testers, RELATION:understand, OBJECT:their target],[SUBJECT:testers,RELATION: perform, OBJECT:wireless LAN discovery]]}.

        You play the role of an entity extraction expert and modify/simplify/split the text (extracted multiple triples) in the entity extraction result I gave you (a python dictionary with key as the source sentence with ellipsis and value as the extracted triples) according to the following rules. A triple is a basic data structure used to represent knowledge graphs, which are structured semantic knowledge bases that describe concepts and their relationships in the physical world. A triple consists of three elements: [SUBJECT, RELATION,OBJECT]. The subject and the object are entities, which can be things, people, places, events, or abstract concepts. The relation is a relation that connects the subject and the object, and expresses how they are related. For example, [Formbook, is, malware] is a triple that describes the relationship between the malware Formbook and the concept of malware.
        Rule 1: If the subject or object in a triple contains pronouns such as it, they, malware, Trojan, attack, ransomware, or group, replace them with a specific name as much as possible according to the context, such as “CVE-xxx” or “XLoader” will replace "it" or "malware" if context has this relationship information.
        Rule 2: Focus on malware, Trojan horse, CVE, or hacking organization as the subject of the triples, if a subject with "malware" or "Trojan horse" or "CVE" or "hacking organization" is found and has additional suffixes, remove the suffixes.
        Rule 3: Split a complex triple into multiple simpler forms. For example, [Formbook and XLoader, are,malware] should be split into [Formbook,is,malware] and [XLoader,is,malware].
        Rule 4: If the [subject,relation] in a triple can be formed into a new [subject,relation,object] triple because relation itself has a new object in it, create a new triple while keeping the original one. 
        Rule 5: If the object can be simplified to a more concise, generic expression, create a new triple while keeping the original one. For example, ["Formbook", "save", "XLoader in desktop"] MUST has a new triple ["Formbook", "save", "XLoader"] due to the object "XLoader in desktop" can be simplified to "XLoader".
        Rule 6: Simplify the subject, object, and relation into a more concise, generic expression.
        Rule 7:When you encounter a subject or object that contains modifiers and adjectives, remove them. For example, [a notorious Formbook malware] should be simplified to [Formbook].
        Rule 8:When you encounter a plural or past tense form, convert it to singular or present tense. For example, [Windows users] should be converted to [Windows user].
        Rule 9:When you encounter an MD5, registry, path, or other identifier that contains prefixes, remove them. For example, [md5 xxxxx] should be simplified to [xxxxx].
        Rule 10:When you encounter a proper noun that contains a suffix, remove the suffix. For example, [“Specific names of a malware/ransomware/trojan” malware/ransomware/trojan] should be simplified to [“Specific names of a malware/ransomware/trojan”]
        Rule 11: Make sure the subject has a prefix "SUBJECT:", the relation has prefix "RELATION:", the object has prefix "OBJECT:", a triple example is "[SUBJECT:Formbook, RELATION:save, OBJECT:a file]

A triple in long-term and short-term memory MUST has THREE elements: [Subject, Relation, Object]. You are now reading a whole article and extract all triples from it. But you can only see part of the article at a time. In order to record all the triples from a article, you have the following long-term memory area to record the triples from the entire article. long-term memory stores information on the aricle parts you have already read.
        -The start of the long-term memory area-
        #Triples will be added here
        -The end of the short-term memory area-
        Second, you now see a part of this article. Based on this part, you already extract such triples and place them in your short-term memory: 
        -The start of the short-term memory area-
        #Triples will be added here
       -The end of the short-term memory area-
        Third, now review your long-term memory and short-term memory. Modify the short-term memory into a new short-term memory. You should follow following rules to modify triples in short-term memory to make them consistent with triples in long-term memory. You should write down how you use the rule to modify the triples in short-term memory. In additional, if you find any triples in long-term memory also need to modify based on the rule, you should also write down how you use the rule to modify the triple in long-term memory, and then add new modified triples in short-term memory as a new triple.

        Rule 1. You notice that in these triples, some triples have subjects and objects that contain partially identical terms and refer to the same specific nouns, but these specific nouns have prefixes/suffixes/modifiers that make them not identical. You should delete the prefixes/suffixes/modifiers and unify them into the same specific nouns.
        Before rule: [the Formbook, is designed to run as, a deleter] [Formbook sample, is designed to run as, one-time encryptor]
        After rule: [Formbook, is designed to run as, a deleter] [Formbook, is designed to run as, one-time encryptor]
        Explanation: The words "the Formbook" and "Formbook sample" refer to the same entity, so they are unified to use the exact same subject "Formbook" for consistency.

        Rule 2. Be especially careful that when you meet specific names of malware,CVE, Trojans, hacker organizations, etc., always use their specific names and remove the prefixes/suffixes/modifiers.
        Before rule: [Malware Formbook, is, malware] 
        After rule: [Formbook, is, malware]
        Explanation: The word "Formbook" is a specific name of malware, so it should be used as the subject of the triple and the prefix "Malware" should be removed.

        Rule 3. Don't add unexisting triples to your new short-term memory. 
        Suppose you find in long-term memory: [the malware, download, Leafminer] and in short-term memory: [Formbook, is, malware]. You cannot add a new triple in new short term memory: [Formbook, download, Leafminer]. Because you don't have evidence that "the malware" in the long-term memory specifically refers to "Formbook".

        Rule 4. Don't add unexisting triples that don't exsit in long-term memory or short-term memory to your new short-term memory. You should add triples from long-term memory or short-term memory to your new short-term memory, not from your imagination and selfcreation

        Rule 5. Don't add any example word like 'Formbook','XLoader','Leafminer', 'FinSpy', 'Kismet' in your new short-term memory area, they are just example words not the real triples in the long term memory area or short term memory area.

        Rule 6. new short-term memory area must be started with \'-The start of new short-term memory area-\' and ended with \'-The end of new short-term memory area-\'. A triple in new short-term memory MUST has THREE elements: [Subject, Relation, Object]. 
        This is an example to help understand the question:
         -The start of the long-term memory area-  
         [SUBJECT:AgumonHacker, RELATION:disrupts, OBJECT:network operations], [SUBJECT:HackGroup Gabumon, RELATION:targets, OBJECT:financial institutions], [SUBJECT:Malware Biyomon, RELATION:steals, OBJECT:personal data], [SUBJECT:CyberAttack 2042, RELATION:compromised, OBJECT:database systems],  [SUBJECT:A sample of Biyomon, RELATION:save, OBJECT:a payload]
         -The end of the long-term memory area-

        -The start of the short-term memory area-  
         [SUBJECT:The AgumonHacker Trojan, RELATION:created by, OBJECT:a sophisticated hacker group], [SUBJECT:Gabumon hackers, RELATION:launched, OBJECT:series of phishing campaigns], [SUBJECT:Biyomon malware program, RELATION:encrypts, OBJECT:files for ransom], [SUBJECT:Attack in 2042, RELATION:led to, OBJECT:sensitive leaks],[SUBJECT:Biyomon, RELATION:run, OBJECT:payload]
        -The end of the short-term memory area-

        Correct answer example:
        Modifications required based on the rules:
        Apply Rule 1 and Rule 2: Unify subjects and objects with partially identical terms and remove any prefixes/suffixes/modifiers, particularly for specific names like malware and hacker groups.
        Modified short-term memory:

        [SUBJECT:The AgumonHacker Trojan, RELATION:created by, OBJECT:a sophisticated hacker group] → [SUBJECT:AgumonHacker, RELATION:created by, OBJECT:sophisticated hacker group]
        [SUBJECT:Gabumon hackers, RELATION:launched, OBJECT:series of phishing campaigns] → [SUBJECT:HackGroup Gabumon, RELATION:launched, OBJECT:phishing campaigns]
        [SUBJECT:Biyomon malware program, RELATION:encrypts, OBJECT:files for ransom] → [SUBJECT:Malware Biyomon, RELATION:encrypts, OBJECT:files for ransom]
        [SUBJECT:Attack in 2042, RELATION:led to, OBJECT:sensitive leaks] → [SUBJECT:CyberAttack 2042, RELATION:led to, OBJECT:sensitive data leaks]

        I also find a triple in long-term memory that needs to be modified based on Rule 1 and Rule 2:

        [SUBJECT:A sample of Biyomon, RELATION:save, OBJECT:a payload] → [SUBJECT:Biyomon, RELATION:save, OBJECT:payload]

        Apply Rule 3 and 4 and 5: We must ensure we do not create unexisting triples when merging the memories.
        After applying the modifications, we now create a new short-term memory area:

        -The start of new short-term memory area- 
        [SUBJECT:AgumonHacker, RELATION:created by, OBJECT:sophisticated hacker group], 
        [SUBJECT:HackGroup Gabumon, RELATION:launched, OBJECT:phishing campaigns],
        [SUBJECT:Biyomon, RELATION:encrypts, OBJECT:files for ransom],
        [SUBJECT:CyberAttack 2042, RELATION:led to, OBJECT:sensitive data leaks],
        [SUBJECT:Biyomon, RELATION:run, OBJECT:payload],
        [SUBJECT:Biyomon, RELATION:save, OBJECT:payload] 
        -The end of new short-term memory area-

        Now, let's swtich to another article. 
        -The start of the long-term memory area-
        ''' + str(longmem) + '''
        -The end of the long-term memory area-

        -The start of the short-term memory area-
        ''' + str(shortmem) + '''
        -The end of the short-term memory area-

        Now, follow the rules. Write down how you use the rule to modify the triples in short-term memory. Then, write down new short-term memory which must be started with \'-The start of new short-term memory area-\' and ended with \'-The end of new short-term memory area-\'
